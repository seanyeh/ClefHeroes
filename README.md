## Description

Our colorful clef hero friends are trying to get home, and it's up to YOU to
help them!

Clef Heroes is a cute and fun game to help you practice reading music. With two
modes (PRACTICE and CHALLENGE), and four speed settings, it is great for
musicians of ALL levels.

For beginners, try out the Treble Clef on Slow, and for the more advanced, try
to master all seven musical clefs! Treble, Bass, Alto, Tenor, Soprano,
Mezzo-Soprano, and Baritone
